## **Introduction**

In the world of cloud computing, infrastructure as code (IaC) plays a pivotal role in automating the deployment and management of resources. This blog post provides a step-by-step guide on creating a Two-Tier architecture on AWS using Terraform. We’ll explore the essential services involved, ensuring high availability, security, and scalability for hosting a static website.

Also, we are adopting a modular approach with enhanced security measures. The infrastructure is organized into dedicated modules, ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and secure deployment.

This modular approach enhances the project’s maintainability, making it easier to manage and scale as your infrastructure requirements evolve. Each module focuses on a specific aspect of the infrastructure, promoting reusability and clarity in configuration.

## **Pre-requisites**

Before diving into the infrastructure creation, make sure you have the following:

* An AWS Account
    
* Terraform installed on your local machine
    
* AWS Access and Secret Access keys configured
    
* Domain Name Configured manually and add the Name Servers to your Domain Provider
    

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

To get started, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NotHarshhaa/DevOps-Projects
```

Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd DevOps-Projects/DevOps Project-11
```

# **Planning and Deployment**

Execute the following Terraform commands to plan and deploy the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=variables.tfvars
```

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=variables.tfvars --auto-approve
```

## **Clean-up**

When you’re done exploring the Two-Tier architecture and want to avoid incurring unnecessary costs, follow these steps to clean up the resources:

Run the following command to initiate the destruction of the infrastructure.

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file=variables.tfvars --auto-approve
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:736/1*FiUFrihAMmQz7LO0BNJvfQ.png align="left")

Delete the Repository (Optional):

* If you cloned the Git repository for this project and no longer need it, you can delete it locally.
    

```bash
rm -rf DevOps-Projects
```

This step is optional and depends on whether you plan to reuse the repository for future exploration.

By following these clean-up steps, you ensure that AWS resources are properly decommissioned, and you won’t incur unnecessary charges. Always exercise caution when performing destructive actions like `terraform destroy` to avoid unintended consequences.

## **Conclusion**

In this comprehensive guide, we embarked on a journey to deploy a Two-Tier architecture on AWS using Terraform. Embracing a modular approach with enhanced security measures, our infrastructure is organized into dedicated modules, offering scalability, maintainability, and robust security.
